    "text": "At Clarot’s German Shepherds, we strive to produce dogs who embody superior temperament, correct conformation, a keen will to work and above all great health. Our selective breeding program allows you to choose from the finest blood lines Germany has to offer. Our love for the German Shepherd dog started over 30 years ago. I have enjoyed working with my dogs both in the sport of Schutzhund and in the show ring. The ideal German Shepherd dog is a working dog with a reliable character that shows a strong degree of beauty and nobility.\n\nI am among countless people worldwide whose lives are richer for knowing and loving a German Shepherd, the most versatile of dog breeds. The breed was developed to serve man and woman, and also to work for us and with us.\n\nAs a breeder, it is my goal to continue producing dogs that are loyal and amazing companions that are able to succeed and adapt to the lifestyle that they are given."

Lino is such a responsible person. We don’t have experience with dogs at all. Whenever we have any questions, we either message or email Lino and he always responds promptly and gives us a lot of valuable suggestions. Lino is so helpful and supportive. I would recommend Clarot’s German Shepherds to my friends.",

After Sam passed in January 2021, we were grateful to be able to pick up our Jake in July. He is an amazing dog. People in our community are always commenting on the colouring and beauty of our boy(s). And over the years Lino has been there for sharing and for support. Our dog(s) are always with us all day, every day, wherever we go and the devotion and affection we get in return is why we love Lino's shepherds.",

The second most important aspect for me is fluent movement. She has a great build and her movement is already quite beautiful. She is flexible, quick and strong. I can’t wait to watch her continue to grow mentally and physically.",

      "body": "German shepherds are very loyal companions. They both make excellent pets. The easiest way to decide is tell the breeder your current situation at home i.e. Do you have other pets? Are they males or females? How much time do you have? Have you had shepherds before? His/her experience can be very helpful when making that decision."
